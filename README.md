# A Genetic Algorithm for Solving a Container Storage Problem Using a Residence Time Strategy

## DISCRIPTION

The code is just an implementation of the research paper under the title  
"A Genetic Algorithm for Solving a Container Storage Problem Using a Residence Time Strategy"  
We used a normal code(with out any Metaheuristic Algorithm), and the Genetic Algorithm(GA), and the Biography Based Optimization(BBO) Algorithm: Metaheuristics.  
There isn't to much to say, so please read the research paper:  
`paperResources/A Genetic Algorithm for Solving a Container Storage Problem Using a Residence Time Strategy.pdf`
